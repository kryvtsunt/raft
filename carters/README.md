PROJECT5: Distributed Replicated Key-Value Store
Partners: Tymofii Kryvtsun, Carter Codell

For the Milestone submission we've implemented basic functionality
(leader election, redirection of get/put msgs to leader, respond to get/put msgs by the leader)
to pass first 7 tests of ./test.py.

We have not encountered any serious issues.
